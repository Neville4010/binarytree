Expression Binary Tree
Second Assessment for CS1527 Object-Orientated Programming

To run the program, the user will be prompted to input their mathematical equation that should be in the format (X?Y) where the X and Y are operands (digits between 0 and 9) and ? is the operator +, -, /, *.
Validation checks for user input are:
1. mismatched brackets
2. wrong number of operands
3. wrong number of operators

the validation checks will also list all issues with user input if there are more than one issue.

When an expression successfully passes these inputs, it will then be converted into postfix notation, then an expression tree. This expression tree will then be traversed in inorder, preorder, postorder, and breadth width traversal (all displayed) before a visual representation of the expression tree is displayed below in inorder traversal.
